        <h2>About the MA61 Celica Supra</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Toyota produced five generations of Supra.
          <li>The <span class="Red">first generation</span> was produced in 1978 as a variant of the Celica. 
          <li> First generation model numbers were MA45, MA55, MA46, MA47, MA56.
          <li> The main concept was to produce a car with a 6-cylinder engine to compete with Datsun's range of 6-cylinder Z-cars. To enable this Celica Supra's were generally longer that Celica's.
          <li> Celica Supra's were also styled differently.
          <li>The <span class="Red">second generation</span> was produced from 1982.
          <li>Model numbers were MA61, MA63, MA67 and GA61.
          <li>My celica as pictured above was a UK specification MA61.
          <li>This car featured the 2,759cc 5M-GE inline 6-cylinder engine which produced 178 horsepower.
          <li>This was paired with the W58 5-speed manual transmission.
          <li>Europe, UK and New Zeland cars all shared the same specifications. 
          <li>Japan, Australia, Switzerland, Sweden, the US and Canada cars had differing specifications.
          <li>The second generation the Celica Supra included pop-up headlights and an electronic dashboard.
